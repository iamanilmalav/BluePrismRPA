Utility - PDF

A Blue Prism Object, with all necessary and basic PDF actions.
It is very difficult to get a decent PDF functionality for Blue Prism Processes. I have created the very basic PDF functionalities with which you can extract PDF text, Get PDF Text Page wise, or Merge 2 PDF files into one. All the functionalities are headless and can be used without the need of a PDF reader application.

Pre Requisites: 
1.) iTextSharp DLL
2.) BouncyCastle DLL
3.)  'Utility - Collection Manipulation' Object VBO
4.) 'Utility - File Management' Object VBO
5.) 'Utility - Strings' Object VBO

Steps to Use the release in your project:
1.) Import the **Utility - PDF** in your Blue Prism.
2.) Get the iTextSharp.dll from the project folder path _"\iTextSharp\lib\itextsharp.dll"_
3.) Get the BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll from the project folder path _"\BouncyCastle\lib\BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll"_
4.) Copy both the DLL files to your Blue Prism Installation path _(Default path is : "C:\Program Files\Blue Prism Limited\Blue Prism Automate")_.
5.) Utility - PDF VBO is ready to use now.
